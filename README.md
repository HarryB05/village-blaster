# Village Blaster

A silly little game where you shoot villagers in a 3D environment. Created because I was bored and thought it would be funny.

## How It Was Made

This project was created by me prompting Cursor to build a simple 3D game. I basically just told it what I wanted and it wrote most the code for me.

## Features

- 3D environment with trees and houses
- Villagers that wander around
- First-person shooting mechanics
- Score tracking
- Game over screen when all villagers are eliminated
- Pew-pew effects
- ðŸ”« emoji because why not

## How to Play

1. Click anywhere on the screen to start
2. Use WASD to move around
3. Use your mouse to look around
4. Left click to shoot
6. When all villagers are dead, you can restart the game

## Technical TLDR

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses pointer lock API for mouse controls
- Simple collision detection
- Basic AI for villager movement

## Why?

Why not?

## Credits

- The villagers: For being such good target practice
